# Console-Calculator
This was mainly a fun practice/learning project. The calculator which is written in C# supports all basic math operators
with some extra things like factorial and binary operations. The TreeViewer project is a perfect-tree drawing program which i was originally thinking about hooking up to the parse tree which the calculator parser generates for debugging purposes. I may still do that in the future since the tree drawing is pretty much done already anyways, but we'll see.
